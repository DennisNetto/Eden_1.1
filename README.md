# Eden_1.1
After a little over two years of development from the original repo, this system has been deemed functional but insecure. This project, as of January 2022, is terminated and is being ported to Edenbridge 2.0. Edenbridge 2.0 will be known as Time Minds. This new system will take advantage of Django's middleware for security and overall better flow.
